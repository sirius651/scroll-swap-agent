## Scroll Swap Agent

## Getting Started ðŸš€

The contract was deployed to scroll sepolia.
On the chat interface, the user's query is judged by the LLM and the information that fits the answer is branched out through the appropriate tool. In this project, we have implemented coin price information, graphs, detailed data analysis, and user's balance, minting, and AMM-based coin swap. For this swap, we used Pyth's price feed to determine the price of the coin swap with oracle price. also used with alchemysdk to get balance for the user address.


1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory (next to `.env.example`) and add the following:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=                        # Get one at https://platform.openai.com
   POLYGON_API_KEY=                       # Get one at https://polygon.io/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=           # Get one at https://alchemy.com/
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
